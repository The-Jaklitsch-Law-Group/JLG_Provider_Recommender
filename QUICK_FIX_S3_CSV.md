# Quick Fix for S3 CSV Data Pull Error

## Problem
Getting "Excel file format cannot be determined" error when pulling CSV files from S3.

## Root Cause
Streamlit app is running with cached/stale version of the `src.data.preparation` module that doesn't have the latest CSV fallback fixes.

## Solution

**You need to restart your Streamlit app** to pick up the code changes:

1. **Stop the current Streamlit app** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Clear Python cache files** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # From the repo root directory
   find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
   # Or on Windows in PowerShell:
   Get-ChildItem -Path . -Directory -Recurse -Filter "__pycache__" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
   ```

3. **Restart Streamlit**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Try the S3 pull again** - it should now work with CSV files

## What Was Fixed

The code in `src/data/preparation.py` now has better error handling for the CSV/Excel detection:

- ‚úÖ Tries CSV first if filename ends with `.csv`
- ‚úÖ Falls back to Excel if CSV fails  
- ‚úÖ Tries Excel ‚Üí CSV ‚Üí Excel (no sheet) for non-CSV filenames
- ‚úÖ Provides detailed error messages if all attempts fail

## Verification

After restarting, when you click **"üîÅ Pull & Refresh Latest from S3"**, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Successfully downloads CSV files from S3
- ‚úÖ Processes them without "Excel file format" errors
- ‚úÖ Creates cleaned parquet files

If you still get errors after restarting, the detailed error message will now show:
- What format detection attempts were made
- The specific error from each attempt
- The filename that was being processed

This will help us diagnose any remaining issues.
