# Data Loading Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was displaying "No provider data available" error when S3 credentials were not configured, even though local parquet cache files existed in `data/processed/`.

## Root Cause
The data ingestion system was strictly requiring S3 configuration and returning empty DataFrames when S3 was not available, without attempting to fall back to local cached parquet files.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added Local Parquet Fallback** (`src/data/ingestion.py`)
- Created `_load_from_local_parquet()` method that loads data from local parquet files
- Maps each `DataSource` to its corresponding parquet file:
  - `INBOUND_REFERRALS` ‚Üí `cleaned_inbound_referrals.parquet`
  - `OUTBOUND_REFERRALS` ‚Üí `cleaned_outbound_referrals.parquet`
  - `ALL_REFERRALS` ‚Üí `cleaned_all_referrals.parquet`
  - `PREFERRED_PROVIDERS` ‚Üí `cleaned_preferred_providers.parquet`
  - `PROVIDER_DATA` ‚Üí `cleaned_outbound_referrals.parquet` (with aggregation)

### 2. **Updated Data Loading Flow** (`src/data/ingestion.py`)
- Modified `_load_and_process_data()` to attempt local fallback when S3 download fails
- Updated `load_data()` to:
  - Show warning (not error) when S3 is not configured
  - Attempt local parquet fallback
  - Only show error if both S3 and local files are unavailable

### 3. **Improved Error Handling** (`src/utils/providers.py`)
- Removed silent exception swallowing in `load_and_validate_provider_data()`
- Added proper logging to track data loading process
- Removed direct `st.error()` calls (errors should be handled by calling code)

### 4. **Enhanced Error Messages** (`pages/1_üîé_Search.py`)
- Added detailed error information display
- Added troubleshooting guide in expandable section
- Shows full exception traceback for debugging

### 5. **Better Logging** (`src/app_logic.py`)
- Added logging to track fallback loader behavior
- Re-raises exceptions instead of silently catching them

### 6. **Updated Startup Process** (`app.py`)
- Modified `auto_update_data_from_s3()` to handle S3-not-configured gracefully
- Still attempts to preload data from local files when S3 is unavailable
- Updates status message to indicate local cache usage

## Behavior Now

### With S3 Configured:
1. App downloads latest data from S3
2. Processes and caches data
3. Shows "‚úÖ ETL complete" status

### Without S3 Configured:
1. App detects S3 is not configured
2. Shows warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è S3 not configured ‚Äî using local cache files as fallback"
3. Loads data from parquet files in `data/processed/`
4. App functions normally with cached data

### When Both Fail:
1. Shows clear error message
2. Provides troubleshooting guide
3. Displays full exception for debugging

## Testing
Restart the Streamlit app and navigate to the Search page. The app should now:
- Load data from local parquet files if S3 is not configured
- Show appropriate warnings/errors with helpful guidance
- Function properly using cached data

## Notes for Production
- S3 should always be configured in production (`.streamlit/secrets.toml`)
- Local parquet files are **cache files only**, auto-generated from S3 data
- The fallback is intended for development/testing, not production use

## Files Modified
1. `src/data/ingestion.py` - Added fallback logic
2. `src/utils/providers.py` - Improved error handling
3. `src/app_logic.py` - Better logging and exception propagation
4. `pages/1_üîé_Search.py` - Enhanced error display
5. `app.py` - Updated startup process to handle S3 gracefully
